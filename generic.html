									<p>Hi, I'm Jack Rarer, a second year CM major. I stumbled into this semester hoping for some clarity about my future to be handed to me on a silver platter. Truthfully, I've never known what I wanted to do with myself. Filmmaker, journalist and, most recently, UI designer were all ideas I floated, but I never felt sure of them. Honestly, I still don't. </p>
									<p>One of the most heartbreakign realizations I had this year was that I don't like makign websites. I don't know how to make them work well. I don't know how to make them look pretty. The thought of career in UI/UX is terrifying right now. I know that might change after a few more classes and some more time to plant my feet, but I really had to reevaluate this semester.</p>
									<p>Even still, I haven't lost my passion for CM. My classes have made me super excited about media and the limitless potential behind it. I've seen and studied some of the most briliant pieces of media ever crafted, and I've tried my hand at creating my own art to mixed results but consistent enjoyment and passion. I'm not sure where this degree will take me, and I'm certainly straying from my original UI plan, but I'm excited to keep moving forward.</p>
