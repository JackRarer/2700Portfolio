									<p>This was the first project for 2700 that felt genuinely open ended. Our themes and approach were entirely up to us, and it was both frustrating and rewarding to pull this project together. It was also the first time I really had to rely on teamwork.</p>

											<p>Naturally, we chose to "uwuify" twitter - to rearrange text to make it look like an stereotypical anime girl was saying it. This feels much weirder now that I'm typing it out.</p>

												<h3>The Work</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This was also the hardest project of the semester for me. I 100% lean more into the visual/media side of things, and API backend work was not for me. Going back and forth through Twitter's API tutorials was torture. Never again.</p> 
											<p>Luckily, my teammates and I worked together to figure it out, and the collaberative process genuinely felt rewarding. Most times in projects like these, I leave them feeling like a solo project would have been more efficient, but it couldnt be further from the truth.</p>
